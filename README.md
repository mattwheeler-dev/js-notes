# js-notes

Notes app built with JavaScript

Saves notes to your LocalStorage so they should persist after page refresh.

- Add (+) Note button will create a new note with default content.
- Edit (pen) button will turn the note into a textarea which you can edit and then save using the save button (the floppy disk where the edit button used to be)
- Delete (trash can) button removes the note from the screen and your LocalStorage as well

Please let me know if you experience any issues or have any feedback.
